# Bacterial_Diffusion_ENGS30
This repository contains a Matlab script that models the 'diffusion' of a bacteria through a glucose concentration gradient. Three plots can be generated. The first plot shows the X, Y, and Z position observed over time in seperate plots. The second and third plots show the evolution of the position of the bacteria in three space using different gradients in different directions. 

The starting position, concentration gradient magnitude, concentration substance (acid or glucose), concentration gradient direction, and bacterial speed can all be altered in the simulation.
